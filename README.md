# Gambling Software

## Description
A gambling software that allows users to play a game of chance.

## Usage
1. Run `cargo run` in the terminal.
2. Enter the amount of money you want to bet.
3. Enter the number you want to bet on.
4. If you win, you will get 10 times the amount you bet. If you lose, you will lose the amount you bet.
5. You can keep playing until you run out of money.

## How it works
The program uses the `random` module to generate a random number between 1 and 10. If the number you bet on matches the random number, you win. Otherwise, you lose.
